Objective:
Play as a blue cell and survive all three levels by dodging all incoming cells.
Each level has a certain number of cells that will be deployed. When that number reaches 0, you can move onto the next level

Losing:
Touching the border of the screen will result in a lost.
Touching an enemy cell will result in a lost.

Cells:
1) Player: You will play as a blue cell.
2) Red: The most basic enemy cell. These cells are slow and will only move in a straight line across the screen.
3) Gray: These cells will begin to track the player but will die in approximately 3 seconds.
4) Pink: Similar to gray cells, however, these cells will explode upon death and release smaller tracking pink cells. Be careful not to stay too close.
5) Small Pink: Released by larger pink cells, these have a short life time and will track the player.
6) Blue: These cells won't track, but they are equally as dangerous and require a faster reaction time.
